## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS CLAMP!! So much CLAMP, not a SINGLE MEDIA QUERY!

Even if it's not perfect, it's closer than I've ever gotten on something of this level.


### Continued development

I'm going to keep on using clamp when I can, and using the tools I have available to me to make the process of translating design into product easier! This was the nicest time I've had in a while building an exercise.

### Useful resources

- [Clamp calculator](https://www.marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/m) - This helped me get my clamps down! It's not very intuitive for me to create the formulas by hand so this was greatly appreciated.
